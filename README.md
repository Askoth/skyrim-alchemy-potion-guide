Skyrim Alchemy Potion Guide
======

This is a way to search and match skyrim alchemy ingredients for specific effects.

I did this as an exercise to use githu pages and learn more about templates.

##how to use this

Type on the text field and it will search by ingredients and effects with that text.

Use **&** between two words to search for both words on the same ingredient ("frost & fire" will search for ingredients with both effects)

Use **|** between two words to search for both words in the same ingredient or in different ingredients.


##about

When playing the game I felt the need to quickly check what are the effects of ingredients even if I don't have them at the time. I also loved the idea of combination and a must to carry less weight.

I focused on making it work. There is room for a lot of optimizations and some I plan to do in the near future (to work better on mobile)

I still need to plan a nice layout for this.

Later I will implement AND and OR keywords to get easier to use this on ipad.
